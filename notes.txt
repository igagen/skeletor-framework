Getters and Setters
-------------------

need easy ability to convert entire object to JSON
  attach nested models inline in attrs

need sensible attribute structure

  attrs, would contain just the attributes your model is responsible for
  where do nested models go?

all top level accessors have getter setter defined on model object, pointing to attr
any Object, Array, or Model attrs, have delegates


toJSON
  loop thru attrs, if nested model, call toJSON on it


attrs:
  name: null
  level: null
  wealth:
    str: null
    dex: null
    con: null
    int: null
    wis: null
    cha: null

delegates:
  abilities: ModelDelegate
  skills: ObjectDelegate
  languages: ArrayDelegate
  abilities: ObjectDelegate


Abilities
  @attrs:
    str: Number
    dex: Number
    con: Number
    int: Number
    wis: Number
    cha: Number

Character
  @attrs:
    name: String
    level: Number
    abilities: Abilities
    skills: Object
    languages: Array
    wealth:
      platinum: Number
      gold: Number
      silver: Number
      copper: Number




c = new Character()
c.abilities.str = 18
c.get('abilities.str')
c.set('abilities.dex', 16)
c.get('abilities.dex')
c.abilities.get('dex')
c.abilities.dex



character.get('name')
character.name
character.set('name', 'Turan')
character.name = 'Turan'
character.languages.add('common')
character.languages.remove('common')
character.languages.length
character.languages.get(0)
character.languages.set(0, 'elven')
character.skills.get('appraisal')
character.skills.set('appraisal', 2)


instance has attrs variable that holds all data for that model
instance has delegates object that handles delegation for getters and setters

character.skills will return ObjectModel instance
character.abilities will return Abilities instance
character.abilities.str will call getter on Abilities instance


Delegation:

loop through attributes.
remove models and add to delegates list.
models can only appear at the first level of the hierarchy

character.name - return attrs.name
character.deep.nested - return attrs.deep.nested
character.skills - return

delegate object, has reference to attributes, and potentially other delegate objects


attrs:
  a: String
  b: Number
  c:
    d: String
    e:
      f: Number

delegates:
  c:
    d:


delegate:
  attrs:
    name
    age
    abilities - model
    deep - delegate
